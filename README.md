### Saving your code ###

In git, there are three steps to saving code:

1. stage your changes (determine what you will save)
2. commit your changes (save changes locally)
3. push your changes (save your changes to the remote repository - the cloud)

In eclipse, you can do all these steps and more in the team menu by selecting Commit:

You will see the staging view, where you can drag changes from unstaged to staged and commit and push to save both locally and on the server or just commit to save only locally.

Try making a minor change to the starter code. Then stage, commit and push the change.

Go to bitbucket and confirm the change shows up in the repository online.

Go to another computer and clone your project.

Make another small change. Then stage, commit and push the change.

Go back to your original computer and select pull in the team menu to pull changes. This will update your local repository to include any changes on the server.
