 * Scenery objects are NON-TAKEABLE items meant to be added to rooms to match things

 * and the room description says
 * 
 * "In the middle of the park stands a lonely tree.  Off in the distance you see
 *  icecaps on snowy mountain."
 *  
 * then you should probably make a Scenery object for the Tree and a Scenery object
 * for the mountains so that the viewer can "examine" them but not interact with
 * them or pick them up.
